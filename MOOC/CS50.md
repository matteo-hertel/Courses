# Sections
Lectures are supplemented by weekly, 90-minute sections led by the teaching fellows. Sections provide you with opportunities to explore the course’s material in a more intimate environment.


# Problem Sets
Nine problem sets are assigned during the semester. Each is due by 31 December 2016.

In order to accommodate students with different backgrounds, some problem sets are released in two editions: a standard edition intended for most students and a "Hacker Edition" intended for some students. Both editions essentially cover the same material. But the Hacker Edition typically presents that material from a more technical angle and poses more sophisticated questions. To receive a Verified Certificate from HarvardX, you must submit the standard editions of problem sets. You are welcome to do the Hacker Editions for your own edification, but it is not possible to submit Hacker Editions for credit (or extra credit).

A schedule of problem sets appears below.

- Problem Set 0: Scratch

- Problem Set 1: C

- Problem Set 2: Crypto

- Problem Set 3: Game of Fifteen

- Problem Set 4: Forensics

- Problem Set 5: Mispellings
